# skullfuck-omega
A proof-of-concept assymetric encryption toolset influenced by obscure Turing-complete langagues and general neural obfuscation techniques. Equal parts mathematics, NLP, symbolic logic, quantum computing, MKUltra-inspired psychology, and just a light sprinkle of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. 

Primarily aimed at future industrial society and its horizon-visible insurrection committees.
